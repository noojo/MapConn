# MapConn
Bay Area Traffic Map

This is a hack of something I found on SO, and now I cant find the link. INSERT LINK HERE.

If you want a command center style traffic map of your area, just change the long/lat and it will center on you.

Whats the big deal? This one refreshes and stays updated. Google maps does not, unless you manually refresh it of course.

Got an old mac mini with a VGA flat panel? Make it your command center! Set the mac's power saver to NEVER, and then ssh into the box and run:

open -a \"Google Chrome\" --args --kiosk <your url>/mapconn-2.html

--kiosk throws it into full screen no window chrome mode, so its just the map. Like on TV!

Coming soon:

more map info overlays.
